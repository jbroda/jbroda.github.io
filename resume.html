              Quad-DSP board. A user of the driver supplied memory addresses of 
              input and output X-ray images, configured image-processing 
              algorithms, and initiated DMA transfers to and from the board. The

            <TD>Designed and implemented a FLASH memory programmer (flasher) 
              for the MDSL line card. It consisted of a flasher module running 
              on a Motorola processor and a TCL/Expect script running on a SUN 
              workstation. The Expect script communicated with the flasher 
              through an RS/232 serial port. </TD></TR>

            <TD>Built a simple frequency spectrum analyzer using a Motorola 
              DSP56301 PCI development board and a personal computer. As part of 
              the project, wrote a Linux driver for the interface between the 
              PCI board and a PC; wrote software in assembly for acquisition and 
              processing of digital signals for the DSP56301; wrote a data 
              plotting application in Tcl/Tk and Expect for the PC. </TD></TR>

            <TD>Developed an automated testing script in TCL/Expect for the 
              MDSL line card. The script issued various testing commands through 
              an RS/232 serial port and, based on their results, performed 
              certain actions. </TD></TR>

            <TD>Designed and implemented wrapper Perl and Shell scripts for 
              the PVCS version control system. The scripts provided additional 
              functionality required by the engineering team and missing from 
              PVCS. </TD></TR>
